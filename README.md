Scripts in object-oriented data structures and ordered data structures. 

More specific topics covered by these C++ scripts include object-oriented programming, the analysis of asymptotic algorithmic run times, and the implementation of basic data structures including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, heaps and graphs, as well as algorithms for traversals, rebalancing and shortest paths (see below).
