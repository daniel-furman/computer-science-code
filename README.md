Topics covered by these C++ scripts include object-oriented programming, the analysis of asymptotic algorithmic run times, and the implementation of basic data structures including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, heaps and graphs, as well as algorithms for traversals, rebalancing and shortest paths.

### 1. Object-Oriented Data Structures

Image Transformation ([`Code`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/computer-science-fundamentals/blob/master/Week4_ImageTransform_assignment.cpp))

* AWS Cloud 9 configuration
* C++ Std and Classes
* Variable, pointer, and memory
* Stack vs. Heap
* Constructor / Destructor
* Variable storage
* Range-based loop
* Template type and template classes
* Inheritance

### 2. Data Structures (Ordered)

Linked Lists and Merge Sort ([`Code`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/computer-science-fundamentals/blob/master/Week5_LinkedLists_assignment.h))

GenericTree and Tree Traversal ([`Code`](https://github.com/daniel-furman/computer-science-code/blob/master/Week7_tree_assignment.h))

* Array and Linked-list
* Time and space complexity analysis and operation of above
* Queue and Stack
* Trees
* Traversal
* Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree
* Time and space complexity analysis of search
* Balanced Binary Search Tree
* AVL Trees
* B-Tree introduction
* B-Tree operation: insert and search
* Heap and priority-queue
* min-heap, max-heap
* Heap operation: insert, extract-min, build heap, heapify adjustment
* Time and space complexity analysis of above

### 3. Data Structures (Unordered) (in process)
